## How I have built my website

1. I created a GitHub Account
2. I cloned repository from https://github.com/datamaunz
3. I renamed the cloned repository samethozman.github.io
4. I edited the files as described in the README.md
5. Now I am writing my first post by following the advice that I got from the README file.
