### Welcome to my Website

I am a Front-End Web Developer. I graduated from Front-End web Development Bootcamp at [Re-Coded](https://re-coded.com). I am excited to learn something new everyday. <br>
Being a devoloper requires doing research
frequently. I participate to bootcamps to learn
from different people and my learning path is
still moving on. I was a mathematics teacher
and thanks to my experiences I have good
communication and time management skills.
Also I am good at solving complex problems
with my analytical thinking skills.
